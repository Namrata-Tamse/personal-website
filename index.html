    <h4>During my internship with solar secure solutions, I
        worked extensively with web development 
        technologies such, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I 
        successfully completed multiple projects and tasks 
        assigned to me, throughout these experiences, I 
        demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, 
        attention to detail, and the ability to work 
        collaboratively. I also gained valuable experience in 
        project management and agile methodologies, which 
        allowed me to effectively prioritize tasks and meet 
        project deadlines.
        Overall, my internship with this company provided 
        me with a solid foundation in web development and 
        a proven track record of delivering quality results. I 
        am excited to continue building on this experience in
